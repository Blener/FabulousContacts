# Privacy Policy
ElmishContacts only stores your personal data on your device, and never shares it.  
It only accesses your camera and photo library to provide you with the ability to set a profile picture to your contacts.  
ElmishContacts will request access to your position to center the map where you are currently. If you denied it access, it will default on Paris (France).

When the app is deleted, all previous data will be erased from your device.

## Metrics and crashes

Some metrics will be sent by ElmishContacts to a server to monitor the good health of the app and track the useful features.  
For instance if the application crashes, the next time it is launched, an error report will be sent automatically if possible.  
Those metrics are anonymized and don't contain any personal data.
