# Privacy Policy
ElmishContacts only stores your personal data in your device, and never shares it.  
It only accesses your camera and photo library to provide you with the ability to set a profile picture to your contacts.  
ElmishContacts will request access to your position to center the map where you are currently. If you denied it access, it will default on Paris (France).

When the app is deleted, all previous data will be erased from your device.
